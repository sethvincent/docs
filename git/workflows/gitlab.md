## When is this useful?

When building complex software with multiple environments and release targets, Gitlab Flow can provide a framework for dealing with that complexity.

## What are the drawbacks?

Like Git Flow, this workflow has more moving parts than is needed for most libraries or even websites or applications that only deploy to staging and production.
