# Design

## web design guidelines
- Start with a plain index.html file, avoid adding more complexity
- Use atomic, functional css classes
- Everything should work when offline
- Avoid 3rd-party resources like Google Fonts

## questions to ask when building things
- who is this for?
- who does this help?
- who will this harm?
- who will use this for harm?
- how will this be used for harm?
- how do the answers (or lack thereof) to the above change our approach?
